Hello and welcome to my blog! So you might be asking, who are you, what you do and what's this blog about? I'm **Sami from Finland**, I code web apps(I prefer backend over front-end) and this blog is for documenting my **personal projects** and other programming stuff I find interesting.

Starting this blog is a kind of a personal challenge for me. Currently I'm not that comfortable with my written communication in english. Also the actual process of producing text at regular basis is unfamiliar to me. And that's even before the horrors of making these produced texts public.

So I'm expecting to get better at writing, what should you, the reader, expect? At least somewhat regular and hopefully interesting posts. I have already some blogposts about **Python**, **Flask**, **CouchDB**, **Erlang** and **nginx + gunicorn** management crudely outlined. These topics are what I find interesting at the moment and I would say there won't be a sudden change to a totally different topics. So if you find any of those interesting, stay tuned.

Oh, and you might wonder, how often is this regular posting going to happen? For starters, I aim to produce **at least a post per week**. If I find myself to be some sort of a content producing monster, posting interval might even change to daily. But that remains to be seen.
